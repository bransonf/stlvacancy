# STL Vacancy

This repository contains (nearly)  all of the necessary materials to reproduce the vacancy dataset for the City of St. Louis. Currently, data this is not made publicly available by the City is encrypted in this repository, and therefore cannot be accessed.

## Future Implementations

The process in this repository will be used to update the vacancy estimate on a routine basis, and this estimate will be made publicly available with the release of a forthcoming API.

## Licensing

This work is licensed under MIT, allowing for the free use and redistribution of this work.

## Compatibility

Due to the implementation used to read Access database files, the data acquisition is only possible on Linux/Unix systems. A Docker image is provided, however, to enable Windows users the replicate this process (sans protected data)
